# CryptoClustering

The assignment requirements do not specifically call for a detailed readme.md file. Responses to questions can be found in the ipynb file. 

For this assignment, we're exploring unsupervised learning methodologies, specifically utilizing KMeans. The goal of the module was to analyze a set of crypto coins, based on their price changes for intervals of 24h, 7d, 14d, 30d, 60d, 200d and 1y. 

The exercise had us compare two different methods: a standard standard scaled model and a principle component analysis (PCA) model. The former has more 'noise' in the output, while the latter reduces the relevant data by focusing on 3 primary components. 

Throughout the exercise, the data manipulation methods are almost identical after you select your model. This made for an interesting result, as there were some noticable differences in the visualizations at the end. One edit- rather than using '+' to create a composite visualization, I used the '*' symbol to overlay the final two elbow curves. In this case, it worked due to the scale of the data. 

Overall, this was a great introduction to ML and unsupervised learning best practices. There are a long list of real-world applications and I'm looking forward to using these new tools to explore datasets.
